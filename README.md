    For TBWA I utilised replicate.com API capabilities to create an AI backslash image generator.  The backslash being the TBWA companies logo, now embedded in all images.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Every TBWA agency around the world has always produced their own creative backslahes. Whether to commomerate a holiday, event or client partnership. The backslashes are used in pitches, creatives decks or just for the fun of it. Now with the advent of generative AI, I went out to create a backslash AI generator for the company in my spare time. The backslash generator makes use of replicates.com lucataco/illusion-diffusion-hq model, otherwise known as the QR-monster model. But instead of QR-codes I used our companies logo (the backslash) for its guiding template. 

The website is currently available on staging at <a href="https://gentbwanl.wpenginepowered.com/"><b>gen.tbwa.nl</b></a> but will eventually only be accesible for TBWA exmployees.

Key features include:
* The bobblehead talks and uses a typewriter effect.
* Images and/or videos pop-up after a while.
* Ask anything or use the suggested qeuries.
